# Mockup Implementation Best Practices

## 1. Clarify Requirements Upfront

Before starting implementation, ask about:

### Interactive States
- [ ] What should hover state look like?
- [ ] What should active/selected state look like?
- [ ] What should disabled state look like?
- [ ] What should focus state look like?

### Visual Details
- [ ] Specific colors or use context colors?
- [ ] Icons for each action/item?
- [ ] Spacing and alignment preferences?

> **Ask these questions BEFORE coding** - don't assume defaults will match expectations.

## 2. Reference Production Early

When implementing a component that exists in VDC production:

1. **Ask for screenshots** of the production version
2. **Compare your implementation** against production regularly
3. **Note differences** - some are intentional (design improvements), others are bugs

## 3. Keep Running Lists

During implementation, maintain:

### Icons Used
`
Icons in this mockup:
- fa-globe (Global context)
- fa-circle-user (Personal context)
- fa-layer-group (Projects)
...
`

### Design Decisions Made
`
Design decisions:
1. Active state uses 40% opacity for inactive, 100% for active
2. Panel header height: 48px to match top nav
...
`

## 4. Iterative Refinement

Expect multiple rounds of refinement. To minimize back-and-forth:

1. **Implement minimal version first** - get basic structure approved
2. **Add interactivity in layers** - hover, then active, then animations
3. **Check in frequently** - show progress before completing

## 5. CSS Best Practices for Kendo Components

### Targeting Kendo Elements
- Kendo buttons wrap content in .k-button-text - apply flex/gap to this inner element
- Use !important sparingly - it indicates style conflicts that may need proper cascade resolution
- Prefer CSS variables over hardcoded values for consistency

### Common Kendo Overrides
`css
/* Fix button content alignment */
.my-button.k-button {
  display: flex !important;
}
.my-button .k-button-text {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 8px;
}

/* Remove default flat button border */
.my-pill.k-button-flat {
  border: 1px solid var(--vdc-border-subtle) !important;
}
`

## 6. Efficiency Tips

1. **Batch similar changes** - if updating multiple items, do them together
2. **Use find/replace** for consistent naming
3. **Test edge cases early** - empty states, long text, many items
4. **Document as you go** - update components.json incrementally

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Proposal approved (see component-workflow.mdc)
- [ ] All icons verified in vdc-icons.json
- [ ] Interactive states clarified with user
- [ ] Production reference reviewed (if applicable)

## Post-Implementation Checklist

- [ ] All icons added to vdc-icons.json
- [ ] components.json updated with templateChanges and designDecisions
- [ ] Demo documentation reflects actual behavior
- [ ] No linter errors
