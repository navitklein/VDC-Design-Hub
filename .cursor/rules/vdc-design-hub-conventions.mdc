# VDC Design Hub Conventions

## Architecture Rules

- **Standalone Components ONLY** - Never use NgModules
- **Lazy Loading** - Every feature route must be lazy-loaded
- **No Database** - All data is static JSON/Markdown loaded at runtime

## Technology Stack

- Angular 19+ with standalone components
- Kendo UI for Angular with **Fluent theme**
- Tailwind CSS for layout and custom styling
- Font Awesome for icons
- ngx-markdown for content rendering

## File Organization

features/mockups/[slug]/
  [slug].routes.ts
  identity/
  design/
  component-spec/
  content/
    identity.md
    annotations.json

## Naming Conventions

- Feature folders: kebab-case (e.g., personal-workspace)
- Components: PascalCase with .component.ts suffix
- Services: PascalCase with .service.ts suffix
- VDC Library components: Prefix with Vdc (e.g., VdcGridComponent)

## State Management

- Use BehaviorSubject in services for simple state
- Simulator states: 'loading' | 'empty' | 'data' | 'error'
- Annotations toggle: boolean via AnnotationService
